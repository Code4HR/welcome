# List of content ideas for this site (remove them once added)

### Purpose/goals
 * three different audiences:
    * people new on meetup.com
    * people new to physical hangout
    * people that stumble to codeforhamptonroads.org and want more info
 * help reduce the work on the rest of the group each week for indoc of new visitors.
 * don't recreate content that's found elsewhere. Give a intro and context and link to. This is one part syllabus and one part faq.
 * limit the unique-to-our-brigade info. For that we can just link them to our homepage. The hope here is we can make this good enough and maybe generic enough that it's useful for all brigades.
 * cut down on the number of people thinking we'll teach them how to code. We teach people to fish by giving them all the links and opportunities to learn, but we're not hear to train/present on coding. Give them the resources to learn on their own, and welcome them to the group if they still want to help. Be clear that we are not a education provider (but we do a lot of learning and sharing every week!).

## Outline

### Purpose and Foundation
 * snip some text from our homepage, brigade site, and cfa, but don't plagiarize. If other sites have significant content, give a intro and link to it rather then copy.
 * background on cfa and brigade
 * what is civic hacking

### Culture
 * everything open: open source, open discussions
 * we have many projects in many languages, but we're focused on the web (say what that does and doesn't mean)

### Communications and Events
 * hacknights! Bring your laptop/tablet as it's a working group not a presentation (usually).
 * core tools: google groups, meetup.com, irc, github, github, and oh, github
 * get them to signup for each key tool: meetup, google groups, try IRC via webchat

### GitHub
 * It's such a big part of everything we do, it deserves it's own section.
 * Create their account (maybe do this last)
 * View our projects, what do they mean, describe major sections of each project: repo, issues, wiki, etc.
 * How to favorite, follow discussions, etc.
 * http://try.github.io
 * http://youtu.be/gp6v7AXQQTY - Git for Humans (13min)
 * focus less on Git here, maybe put some about it in Coding below

### Coding
 * choose your own adventure, focus on cross-platform web languages
 * They can build something new, or help with any existing project
 * We have plenty of things that need help
 * Experienced: Some use the language they know, some want to learn a new lang
 * point to online courses, free preferred, list others as well
 * http://www.codeschool.com
 * http://www.codecademy.com
 * http://www.codeyear.com
 * HTML/CSS
 * Python
 * JavaScript/Nodejs
 * Ruby

### Calls to Action
 * What else can we inspire them to do?
 * edit a github readme
 * submit an app or data idea
 * find some local open data we didn't know about
 * help spread the word about the brigade to their communities
