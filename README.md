# welcome: Indoc for new brigade members (first hacknight)
=======

Lets put ideas and resources here, and once we have enough for a page, we can create it as welcome.c4hrva.us.

## Purpose/goals
 * three different audiences: 
    * people new on meetup.com
    * people new to physical hangout
    * people that stumble to codeforhamptonroads.org and want more info
  * cut down on the number of people thinking we'll teach them how to code. Give them the resources to learn on their own, and welcome them to the group if they still want to help. Be clear that we are not a education provider.

## How to build it (options)
 * just static html page on github
 * could use this bootstrap template to start http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/examples/fluid.html
 * use http://www.pathwright.com/ or similar service to create a free course

## Outline

### Purpose and Foundation
 * snip some text from our homepage, brigade site, and cfa
 * background on cfa and brigade
 * what is civic hacking

### Culture
 * everything open: open source, open discussions
 * we have many projects in many languages, but we're focused on the web (say what that does and doesn't mean)

### Communication
 * core tools: google groups, meetup.com, irc, github, github, and oh, github
 * get them to signup for each key tool: meetup, google groups, try IRC via webchat

### GitHub
 * It's such a big part of everything we do, it deserves it's own section.
 * Create their account (maybe do this last)
 * View our projects, what do they mean, describe major sections of each project: repo, issues, wiki, etc.
 * How to favorite, follow discussions, etc.
 * http://try.github.io
 * focus less on Git here, maybe put some about it in Coding below

### Coding
 * choose your own adventure, focus on cross-platform web languages
 * They can build something new, or help with any existing project
 * We have plenty of things that need help
 * Experienced: Some use the language they know, some want to learn a new lang
 * point to online courses, free prefered, list others as well

### Calls to Action
 * What else can we inspire them to do?
 * edit a github readme
 * submit an app or data idea
 * find some local open data we didn't know about
 * help spread the word about the brigade to their communities
