# Welcome to Code for America Brigade and {{page.local-chapter-name}}!

Code for America Brigade is an organizing force for local civic engagement - a national network of civic-minded volunteers who contribute their skills toward using the web as a platform for local government and community service.

We are {{page.local-chapter-name}}, the local chapter of Code for America Brigade supporting civic hacking in {{page.location}}.

## Who This is For
Anyone who wants to apply their technology skills toward civic engagement, community service, open government and open civic data.

## What to Expect
You can learn ways in which you can apply your skills toward civic engagement, community service, open government and open, civic data.

* You can find civic technology projects to join.

* You can hack-a-thon.

* You can connect with local government and community organizations on civic tech.

* You can play with open, civic data.

* You can hang out with other civic hackers, eat pizza and drink beverages.

## What Not to Expect

* You can meet a lot of new and interesting people and make useful connections but we are not a networking group.
